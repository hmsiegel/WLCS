# WLCS
## A Weightlifting Competition System For the Rest of Us

</div>

WLCS is a cross-platform weightlifting competition system designed to be easy to use and easy to deploy. It is meant to be used by everyone from small local meets to large national competitions. 

Since the explosion of Crossfit, weightlifting has become more popular than ever. However, running a meet has become more complicated. 
What used to be done with pen, paper, and a clock, now requires multiple computers, network knowledge, and possibly an advanced degree (not really). 
We wanted to change that. We wanted something that not only is easy to set up and use, but we also wanted to look back at past results with ease.

- We wanted WLCS to be fully cross-platform. You should be able to run it on Windows, Mac, or Linux. On the desktop or in the cloud. It shouldn't matter what kind of computer you are using.
- We wanted to be able to access all of the data from anywhere. We wanted to be able to look at past results, see who competed in a meet, and see how they did. We wanted to be able to see how a lifter has done over time. 
- We wanted a beautiful looking program, from the user interface to the display screens.
